## Instructor: [Derek Jensen][instructor url]


Xamarin has been making some very large strides recently in giving developers the ability to share  code across platforms.

As mobile developers, we want to create the polished user experience that a native app can provide. At the same time, we'd like to share code across platforms to make our development process more efficient - including our UI code!

With the continuing evolution of Xamarin.Forms, sharing UI code has become easier and easier. For simple mobile app UIs, it's now possible to have a native UI and cross-platform code reuse!
